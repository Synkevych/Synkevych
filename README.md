### Synkevych Roman @synkevych

Hi there! I'm Web Developer with 3 years' experience. I like to to use Ruby language for his flexible and intuitive syntax that is easy to read. To increase my knowledge with Ruby I recently successfully completed the SoftServe "Ruby Development" course. There we learn many new things about all part of creating app, from chose version of language to deploying app at AWS server and run tests on Trevis CI.	I want to develop in the direction of web development using  Ruby on Rails in Backend and React, Redux in Frontend.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open to new opportunities!
